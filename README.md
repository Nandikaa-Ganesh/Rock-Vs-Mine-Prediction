**Project Summary: Rock vs. Mine Prediction**

**Objective:**
The project focuses on predicting whether sonar readings correspond to rocks or mines using various machine learning models.

**Models Utilized:**
1. **Logistic Regression:**
   - A linear model estimating the probability of belonging to a particular class.

2. **Random Forest:**
   - Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):**
   - Utilizes hyperplanes to separate different classes in the feature space.

4. **Naive Bayes:**
   - Probabilistic classifier assuming independence between features based on Bayes' theorem.

5. **Neural Networks:**
   - Deep learning models with interconnected nodes for learning complex patterns.

6. **Gradient Boosting:**
   - Ensemble technique building sequential trees to correct errors of previous models.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- **Accuracy:**
  - Formula: `(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`
  - Measures the overall correctness of predictions.

- **Precision:**
  - Formula: `TP / (TP + FP)`
  - Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.

- **Recall (Sensitivity):**
  - Formula: `TP / (TP + FN)`
  - Proportion of actual positives correctly predicted.

- **F1-Score:**
  - Formula: `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`
  - Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

- **Classification Report:**
  - Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

- **Confusion Matrix:**
  - A table showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

- **Correlation Matrix:**
  - Measures the linear relationship between features.

**Repository Usage:**
- The GitHub repository includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Model hyperparameters, data sources, and key project details are documented in the repository.
- Detailed explanations, visualizations, and comparative analyses are provided for model performance.
